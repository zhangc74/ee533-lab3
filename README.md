  - `detect7B` for pattern detection
  - `dropfifo` for buffering and dropping packets

## Day 2 – Module Connection
- Connected all modules together
- Fixed some connection issues in the schematics.

## Day 3 – Simulation and Verification
- Used the provided **`ids_tb.tbw`** file as a reference waveform.
- Ran simulation
- Writing reports
